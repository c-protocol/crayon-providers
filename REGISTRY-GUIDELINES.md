# Registry Guidelines and PR Template

To get a provider included in the registry, first submit a pull request that adds a new `.md` file to the `providers` folder. See [example.md](providers/example.md) for a template. 

In the provider's `.md` file, please include the following information: 

- Website URL: 
- Date launched: 
- Company name (if applicable): 
- Contact (email, Discord, etc.): 
- Provider Rate: 
- Product Description: 

**Note:** The Provider Rate is the percentage of XCRAY rewards earned by the user that the provider will **keep**.
