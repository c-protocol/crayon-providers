# Crayon Protocol Providers Registry 

## What are Crayon Protocol Providers? 
The Crayon Protocol team is not running its own frontend â€” making the system more decentralized and censorship-resistant. Instead, Crayon Protocol is counting on its ecosystem to bootstrap access to the protocol.

To make deposits or finance assets, users can use a frontend provided by third parties - the providers. 

To create leveraged trades which require smart contract deployment (just like flash loans), users can also use low-code solution from providers.

By connecting users to Crayon Protocol, providers can earn XCRAY rewards distributed by the protocol.

**Note:** This registry was very strongly inspired by Liquity's Frontend Operator registry.

## What is the Providers Registry? 
This Providers Registry is a place for Crayon Protocol Providers to make their services known. 

**Note:** This registry is *seperate* from registering a provider with the protocol, which is a completely permissionless process. See Crayon Protocol documentation for information on the smart contract interaction needed to be registered with the protocol.

## How to get a provider added to the registry? 
To add a provider to the registry, please refer to the following [guidelines and PR template](REGISTRY-GUIDELINES.md). Any PRs that deviate from the template *will not be added*.

*Note: Adding a provider to the registry is not an automated process, therefore there is no guaranteed timeline for getting your PR accepted. Please be patient.* 

## Provider was added to the Github repository, but not the website? 
Moving providers from the Github repository to the website is a manual process. Please be patient.

## How do I report a malicious frontend? 
If you have reason to believe a provider is a risk to users, please follow the [reporting guidelines here](REPORT-PROVIDER.md).
